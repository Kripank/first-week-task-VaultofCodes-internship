#first-week-task-VaultofCodes-internship
I have successfully completed the first week of my java programming internship with ValtOfCodes.
During this week, I learned how to debug java codes that involve object-oriented programming, arrays, and exception handling. 
I used various tools and techniques such as 
breakpoints, step-by-step execution, print statements, and try-catch blocks to identify and fix errors in the code. 
I also learned how to write clear and concise comments and documentation for the code.I enjoyed working on challenging and interesting problems that helped me improve my logical thinking and problem-solving skills.I am looking forward to learning more and enhancing my java programming skills in the upcoming weeks.
